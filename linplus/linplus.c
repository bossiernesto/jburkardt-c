/*
  Purpose:

    I4_MODP returns the nonnegative remainder of I4 division.

  Discussion:

    If

      NMULT = ( I - NREM ) / J
    then
      I = J * NMULT + NREM

    The MOD function computes a result with the same sign as the
    quantity being divided.  Thus, suppose you had an angle A,
    and you wanted to ensure that it was between 0 and 360.
    Then mod(A,360) would do, if A was positive, but if A
    was negative, your result would be between -360 and 0.

    On the other hand, I4_MODP(A,360) is between 0 and 360, always.

double *r83_cr_fa ( int n, double a[] )

/******************************************************************************/
/*
  Purpose:

    R83_CR_FA decomposes a real tridiagonal matrix using cyclic reduction.

  Discussion:

    The R83 storage format is used for a tridiagonal matrix.
    The superdiagonal is stored in entries (1,2:N), the diagonal in
    entries (2,1:N), and the subdiagonal in (3,1:N-1).  Thus, the
    original matrix is "collapsed" vertically into the array.

    Once R83_CR_FA has decomposed a matrix A, then R83_CR_SL may be used to solve
    linear systems A * x = b.

    R83_CR_FA does not employ pivoting.  Hence, the results can be more
    sensitive to ill-conditioning than standard Gauss elimination.  In
    particular, R83_CR_FA will fail if any diagonal element of the matrix
    is zero.  Other matrices may also cause R83_CR_FA to fail.

    R83_CR_FA can be guaranteed to work properly if the matrix is strictly
    diagonally dominant, that is, if the absolute value of the diagonal
    element is strictly greater than the sum of the absolute values of
    the offdiagonal elements, for each equation.

    The algorithm may be illustrated by the following figures:

    The initial matrix is given by:

          D1 U1
          L1 D2 U2
             L2 D3 U3
                L3 D4 U4
                   L4 D U5
                      L5 D6

    Rows and columns are permuted in an odd/even way to yield:

          D1       U1
             D3    L2 U3
                D5    L4 U5
          L1 U2    D2
             L3 U4    D4
                L5       D6

    A block LU decomposition is performed to yield:

          D1      |U1
             D3   |L2 U3
                D5|   L4 U5
          --------+--------
                  |D2'F3
                  |F1 D4'F4
                  |   F2 D6'

    For large systems, this reduction is repeated on the lower right hand
    tridiagonal subsystem until a completely upper triangular system
    is obtained.  The system has now been factored into the product of a
    lower triangular system and an upper triangular one, and the information
    defining this factorization may be used by R83_CR_SL to solve linear
    systems.

  Example:

    Here is how a R83 matrix of order 5 would be stored:

       *  A12 A23 A34 A45
      A11 A22 A33 A44 A55
      A21 A32 A43 A54  *

/*
  Purpose:

    R83_CR_SL solves a real linear system factored by R83_CR_FA.

  Discussion:

    The matrix A must be tridiagonal.  R83_CR_FA is called to compute the
    LU factors of A.  It does so using a form of cyclic reduction.  If
    the factors computed by R83_CR_FA are passed to R83_CR_SL, then one or 
    many linear systems involving the matrix A may be solved.

    Note that R83_CR_FA does not perform pivoting, and so the solution 
    produced by R83_CR_SL may be less accurate than a solution produced 
    by a standard Gauss algorithm.  However, such problems can be 
    guaranteed not to occur if the matrix A is strictly diagonally 
    dominant, that is, if the absolute value of the diagonal coefficient 
    is greater than the sum of the absolute values of the two off diagonal 
    coefficients, for each row of the matrix.

  Example:

    Here is how a R83 matrix of order 5 would be stored:

       *  A12 A23 A34 A45
      A11 A22 A33 A44 A55

  Purpose:

    R83_GS_SL solves a R83 system using Gauss-Seidel iteration.

  Discussion:

    The R83 storage format is used for a tridiagonal matrix.
    The superdiagonal is stored in entries (1,2:N), the diagonal in
    entries (2,1:N), and the subdiagonal in (3,1:N-1).  Thus, the

    This routine simply applies a given number of steps of the

    simply pass in the zero vector as an approximate solution.  If
    the returned value is not acceptable, you may call again, using

    The R83 storage format is used for a tridiagonal matrix.
    The superdiagonal is stored in entries (1,2:N), the diagonal in
    entries (2,1:N), and the subdiagonal in (3,1:N-1).  Thus, the
    original matrix is "collapsed" vertically into the array.

  Example:

    Here is how a R83 matrix of order 5 would be stored:

       *  A12 A23 A34 A45
      A11 A22 A33 A44 A55

  Purpose:

    R83_NP_FA factors a R83 system without pivoting.

  Discussion:

    The R83 storage format is used for a tridiagonal matrix.
    The superdiagonal is stored in entries (1,2:N), the diagonal in
    entries (2,1:N), and the subdiagonal in (3,1:N-1).  Thus, the
    original matrix is "collapsed" vertically into the array.

    Because this routine does not use pivoting, it can fail even when
    the matrix is not singular, and it is liable to make larger
    errors.

    R83_NP_FA and R83_NP_SL may be preferable to the corresponding
    LINPACK routine SGTSL for tridiagonal systems, which factors and solves
    in one step, and does not save the factorization.

    R83_VXM multiplies a vector times a R83 matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R83 storage format is used for a tridiagonal matrix.
    The superdiagonal is stored in entries (1,2:N), the diagonal in
    entries (2,1:N), and the subdiagonal in (3,1:N-1).  Thus, the
    original matrix is "collapsed" vertically into the array.

  Example:

    Here is how a R83 matrix of order 5 would be stored:

       *  A12 A23 A34 A45
      A11 A22 A33 A44 A55

/*
  Purpose:

    R83NP_FS factors and solves an R83NP system.

  Discussion:

    The R83NP storage format is used for a tridiagonal matrix.
    The subdiagonal   is in entries (0,1:N-1), 
    the diagonal      is in entries (1,0:N-1), 
    the superdiagonal is in entries (2,0:N-2). 

    This algorithm requires that each diagonal entry be nonzero.
    It does not use pivoting, and so can fail on systems that
    are actually nonsingular.

    The "R83NP" format used for this routine is different from the R83 format.
    Here, we insist that the nonzero entries
    for a given row now appear in the corresponding column of the
    packed array.

  Example:

    Here is how a R83 matrix of order 5 would be stored:

/*
  Purpose:

    R83P_FA factors a R83P matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R83P storage format stores a periodic tridiagonal matrix is stored as 
    a 3 by N array, in which each row corresponds to a diagonal, and 
    column locations are preserved.  The matrix value 
    A(1,N) is stored as the array entry A(1,1), and the matrix value
    A(N,1) is stored as the array entry A(3,N).

    Once the matrix has been factored by R83P_FA, R83P_SL may be called
    to solve linear systems involving the matrix.

    The logical matrix has a form which is suggested by this diagram:

      D1 U1          L1
      L2 D2 U2
         L3 R83 U3
            L4 D4 U4
               L5 R85 U5
      U6          L6 D6

    The algorithm treats the matrix as a border banded matrix:

      ( A1  A2 )
      ( A3  A4 )

    where:

      D1 U1          | L1
      L2 D2 U2       |  0
         L3 R83 U3    |  0
            L4 D4 U4 |  0
               L5 R85 | U5
      ---------------+---
      U6  0  0  0 L6 | D6

  Example:

    Here is how a R83P matrix of order 5 would be stored:

      A51 A12 A23 A34 A45
      A11 A22 A33 A44 A55
      A21 A32 A43 A54 A15

  Method:

    The algorithm rewrites the system as:

         X1 + inverse(A1) A2 X2 = inverse(A1) B1

      A3 X1 +             A4 X2 = B2

    The first equation can be "solved" for X1 in terms of X2:

         X1 = - inverse(A1) A2 X2 + inverse(A1) B1

    allowing us to rewrite the second equation for X2 explicitly:

      ( A4 - A3 inverse(A1) A2 ) X2 = B2 - A3 inverse(A1) B1

/*
  Purpose:

    R85_NP_FS factors and solves a R85 system.

  Discussion:

    The R85 storage format represents a pentadiagonal matrix as a 5
    by N array, in which each row corresponds to a diagonal, and
    column locations are preserved.  Thus, the original matrix is
    "collapsed" vertically into the array.

    This algorithm requires that each diagonal entry be nonzero.

    No pivoting is performed, and therefore the algorithm may fail
    in simple cases where the matrix is not singular.

  Example:

    Here is how a R85 matrix of order 6 would be stored:

       *   *  A13 A24 A35 A46
       *  A12 A23 A34 A45 A56
      A11 A22 A33 A44 A55 A66
      A21 A32 A43 A54 A65  *

void r8bb_add ( int n1, int n2, int ml, int mu, double a[], int i, int j, 
  double value )

/******************************************************************************/
/*
  Purpose:

    R8BB_ADD adds a value to an entry in a R8BB matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8BB storage format is for a border banded matrix.  Such a
    matrix has the logical form:

      A1 | A2
      ---+---
      A3 | A4

    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, 
    and N2 by N2, respectively.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
    Each block is stored by columns.

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
    the first (2*ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using standard LINPACK
    general band format.  The reason for the factor of 2 in front of
    ML is to allocate space that may be required if pivoting occurs.

    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+ML+MU+1)+(J-1)*(2*ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

/*
  Purpose:

    R8BB_FA factors a R8BB matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8BB storage format is for a border banded matrix.  Such a
    matrix has the logical form:

      A1 | A2
      ---+---
      A3 | A4

    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
    respectively.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
    Each block is stored by columns.

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
    the first (2*ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using standard LINPACK
    general band format.  The reason for the factor of 2 in front of
    ML is to allocate space that may be required if pivoting occurs.

    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+ML+MU+1)+(J-1)*(2*ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).

    Entries of A4:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
      (same formula used for A3).

  Example:

    With N1 = 4, N2 = 1, ML = 1, MU = 2, the matrix entries would be:

       00
       00  00

/*
  Purpose:

    R8BB_PRINT prints a R8BB matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8BB storage format is for a border banded matrix.  Such a
    matrix has the logical form:

      A1 | A2
      ---+---
      A3 | A4

    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
    respectively.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
    Each block is stored by columns.

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
    the first (2*ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using standard LINPACK
    general band format.  The reason for the factor of 2 in front of
    ML is to allocate space that may be required if pivoting occurs.

    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+ML+MU+1)+(J-1)*(2*ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).

    Entries of A4:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
      (same formula used for A3).

  Example:

    With N1 = 4, N2 = 1, ML = 1, MU = 2, the matrix entries would be:

  Discussion:

    R8BB_SL solves a R8BB system factored by SBB_FA.

  Discussion:

    The R8BB storage format is for a border banded matrix.  Such a
    matrix has the logical form:

      A1 | A2
      ---+---
      A3 | A4

    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
    respectively.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
    Each block is stored by columns.

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
    the first (2*ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using standard LINPACK
    general band format.  The reason for the factor of 2 in front of
    ML is to allocate space that may be required if pivoting occurs.

    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+ML+MU+1)+(J-1)*(2*ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).

    Entries of A4:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (2*ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
      (same formula used for A3).

  Example:

    With N1 = 4, N2 = 1, ML = 1, MU = 2, the matrix entries would be:

       00
       00  00

    The full matrix has order N = M * L.  The L by L matrix is Toeplitz,
    that is, along its diagonal, the blocks repeat.

    Storage for the matrix consists of the L blocks of the first row,
    followed by the L-1 blocks of the first column (skipping the first row).
    These items are stored in the natural way in an (M,M,2*L-1) array.

  Purpose:

    R8CB_NP_SL solves a R8CB system factored by R8CB_NP_FA.

  Discussion:

    The R8CB storage format is appropriate for a compact banded matrix.
    It is assumed that the matrix has lower and upper bandwidths ML and MU,
    respectively.  The matrix is stored in a way similar to that used
    by LINPACK and LAPACK for a general banded matrix, except that in
    this mode, no extra rows are set aside for possible fillin during pivoting.
    Thus, this storage format is suitable if you do not intend to factor
    the matrix, or if you can guarantee that the matrix can be factored
    without pivoting.

    R8CB_NP_SL can also solve the related system A' * x = b.

void r8cbb_add ( int n1, int n2, int ml, int mu, double a[], int i, int j, 
  double value )

/******************************************************************************/
/*
  Purpose:

    R8CBB_ADD adds a value to an entry of a R8CBB matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8CBB storage format is for a compressed border banded matrix.  
    Such a matrix has the logical form:

      A1 | A2
      ---+---
      A3 | A4

    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
    respectively.  

    The R8CBB format is the same as the R8BB format, except that the banded
    matrix A1 is stored in compressed band form rather than standard
    banded form.  In other words, we do not include the extra room
    set aside for fill in during pivoting.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
    Each block is stored by columns.

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
    the first (ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using the obvious variant
    of the LINPACK general band format.

    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+MU+1)+(J-1)*(ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).

    Entries of A4:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
      (same formula used for A3).

/*
  Purpose:

    R8CBB_ERROR checks the dimensions of a R8CBB matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8CBB storage format is for a compressed border banded matrix.  
    Such a matrix has the logical form:

      A1 | A2
      ---+---
      A3 | A4

    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
    respectively.  

    The R8CBB format is the same as the R8BB format, except that the banded
    matrix A1 is stored in compressed band form rather than standard
    banded form.  In other words, we do not include the extra room
    set aside for fill in during pivoting.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
    Each block is stored by columns.

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
    the first (ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using the obvious variant
    of the LINPACK general band format.

    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+MU+1)+(J-1)*(ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).

    Entries of A4:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
      (same formula used for A3).

/*
  Purpose:

    R8CBB_FA factors a R8CBB matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8CBB storage format is for a compressed border banded matrix.  
    Such a matrix has the logical form:

      A1 | A2
      ---+---
      A3 | A4

    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
    respectively.  

    The R8CBB format is the same as the R8BB format, except that the banded
    matrix A1 is stored in compressed band form rather than standard
    banded form.  In other words, we do not include the extra room
    set aside for fill in during pivoting.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
    Each block is stored by columns.

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
    the first (ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using the obvious variant
    of the LINPACK general band format.

    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+MU+1)+(J-1)*(ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).

    Entries of A4:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
      (same formula used for A3).


    Once the matrix has been factored by SCCB_FA, SCCB_SL may be called
    to solve linear systems involving the matrix.

    SCCB_FA uses special non-pivoting versions of LINPACK routines to
    carry out the factorization.  The special version of the banded
    LINPACK solver also results in a space saving, since no entries
    need be set aside for fill in due to pivoting.

    The linear system must be border banded, of the form:

      ( A1 A2 ) (X1) = (B1)
      ( A3 A4 ) (X2)   (B2)

    where A1 is a (usually big) banded square matrix, A2 and A3 are
    column and row strips which may be nonzero, and A4 is a dense
    square matrix.

    The algorithm rewrites the system as:

         X1 + inverse(A1) A2 X2 = inverse(A1) B1

      A3 X1 +             A4 X2 = B2

    and then rewrites the second equation as

      ( A4 - A3 inverse(A1) A2 ) X2 = B2 - A3 inverse(A1) B1

    The algorithm will certainly fail if the matrix A1 is singular,
    or requires pivoting.  The algorithm will also fail if the A4 matrix,
    as modified during the process, is singular, or requires pivoting.
    All these possibilities are in addition to the failure that will
    if the total matrix A is singular.

    The R8CBB storage format is for a compressed border banded matrix.

    matrix A1 is stored in compressed band form rather than standard
    banded form.  In other words, we do not include the extra room
    set aside for fill in during pivoting.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+MU+1)+(J-1)*(ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).

    Entries of A4:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
      (same formula used for A3).


    The linear system A * x = b is decomposable into the block system:

      ( A1 A2 ) * (X1) = (B1)
      ( A3 A4 )   (X2)   (B2)

    where A1 is a (usually big) banded square matrix, A2 and A3 are
    column and row strips which may be nonzero, and A4 is a dense
    square matrix.

    All the arguments except B are input quantities only, which are

    they had on exit from R8CBB_FA.

    If more than one right hand side is to be solved, with the same
    matrix, R8CBB_SL should be called repeatedly.  However, R8CBB_FA only
    needs to be called once to create the factorization.

/*
  Purpose:

    R8CBB_TO_R8GE copies a R8CBB matrix to a R8GE matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8CBB storage format is for a compressed border banded matrix.  
    Such a matrix has the logical form:

      A1 | A2
      ---+---
      A3 | A4

    with A1 a (usually large) N1 by N1 banded matrix, while A2, A3 and A4
    are dense rectangular matrices of orders N1 by N2, N2 by N1, and N2 by N2,
    respectively.  

    The R8CBB format is the same as the R8BB format, except that the banded
    matrix A1 is stored in compressed band form rather than standard
    banded form.  In other words, we do not include the extra room
    set aside for fill in during pivoting.

    A should be defined as a vector.  The user must then store
    the entries of the four blocks of the matrix into the vector A.
    Each block is stored by columns.

    A1, the banded portion of the matrix, is stored in
    the first (ML+MU+1)*N1 entries of A, using the obvious variant
    of the LINPACK general band format.

    The following formulas should be used to determine how to store
    the entry corresponding to row I and column J in the original matrix:

    Entries of A1:

      1 <= I <= N1, 1 <= J <= N1, (J-I) <= MU and (I-J) <= ML.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (I-J+MU+1)+(J-1)*(ML+MU+1).

    Entries of A2:

      1 <= I <= N1, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+(J-N1-1)*N1+I.

    Entries of A3:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, 1 <= J <= N1.

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).

    Entries of A4:

      N1+1 <= I <= N1+N2, N1+1 <= J <= N1+N2

      Store the I, J entry into location
      (ML+MU+1)*N1+N1*N2+(J-1)*N2+(I-N1).
      (same formula used for A3).

/*
  Purpose:

    R8CC_KIJ seeks (I,J), the full index of K, the sparse index of a R8CC matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8CC format is the double precision sparse compressed column
    format.  Associated with this format, we have an M by N matrix
    with NZ_NUM nonzero entries.  We construct the column pointer
    vector COL of length N+1, such that entries of column J will be
    stored in positions COL(J) through COL(J+1)-1.  This indexing
    refers to both the ROW and A vectors, which store the row indices
    and the values of the nonzero entries.  The entries of the
    ROW vector corresponding to each column are assumed to be
    ascending sorted.

    The R8CC format is equivalent to the MATLAB "sparse" format,
    and the Harwell Boeing "real unsymmetric assembled" (RUA) format.

double *r8cc_zero ( int m, int n, int nz_num, int col[], int row[] )

/******************************************************************************/
/*
  Purpose:

    R8CC_ZERO zeros a R8CC matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8CC format is the double precision sparse compressed column
    format.  Associated with this format, we have an M by N matrix
    with NZ_NUM nonzero entries.  We construct the column pointer
    vector COL of length N+1, such that entries of column J will be
    stored in positions COL(J) through COL(J+1)-1.  This indexing
    refers to both the ROW and A vectors, which store the row indices
    and the values of the nonzero entries.  The entries of the
    ROW vector corresponding to each column are assumed to be
    ascending sorted.

    The R8CC format is equivalent to the MATLAB "sparse" format,
    and the Harwell Boeing "real unsymmetric assembled" (RUA) format.

  Discussion:

    The R8GB storage format is used for an M by N banded matrix, with lower bandwidth ML

    become rows of the storage array, while columns are preserved.  The
    collapsed array is logically 2*ML+MU+1 by N.  

    The two dimensional array can be further reduced to a one dimensional
    array, stored by columns.

/*
  Purpose:

    R8GB_FA performs a LINPACK-style PLU factorization of a R8GB matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8GB storage format is used for an M by N banded matrix, with lower bandwidth ML
    and upper bandwidth MU.  Storage includes room for ML extra superdiagonals, 
    which may be required to store nonzero entries generated during Gaussian 
    elimination.

    The original M by N matrix is "collapsed" downward, so that diagonals
    become rows of the storage array, while columns are preserved.  The
    collapsed array is logically 2*ML+MU+1 by N.  

    The two dimensional array can be further reduced to a one dimensional
    array, stored by columns.

/*
  Purpose:

    R8GB_TO_R8S3 copies a R8GB matrix to a R8S3 matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8GB storage format is for an M by N banded matrix, with lower 
    bandwidth ML and upper bandwidth MU.  Storage includes room for ML 
    extra superdiagonals, which may be required to store nonzero entries 
    generated during Gaussian elimination.

    The original M by N matrix is "collapsed" downward, so that diagonals
    become rows of the storage array, while columns are preserved.  The
    collapsed array is logically 2*ML+MU+1 by N.  

    LINPACK and LAPACK band storage requires that an extra ML
    superdiagonals be supplied to allow for fillin during Gauss
    elimination.  Even though a band matrix is described as
    having an upper bandwidth of MU, it effectively has an
    upper bandwidth of MU+ML.  This routine will copy nonzero
    values it finds in these extra bands, so that both unfactored
    and factored matrices can be handled.

    The R8S3 storage format corresponds to the SLAP Triad format.

    The R8S3 storage format stores the row, column and value of each nonzero
    entry of a sparse matrix.  The entries may be given in any order.  No
    check is made for the erroneous case in which a given matrix entry is
    specified more than once.

    There is a symmetry option for square matrices.  If the symmetric storage
    option is used, the format specifies that only nonzeroes on the diagonal
    and lower triangle are stored.  However, this routine makes no attempt
    to enforce this.  The only thing it does is to "reflect" any nonzero
    offdiagonal value.  Moreover, no check is made for the erroneous case
    in which both A(I,J) and A(J,I) are specified, but with different values.

    This routine reorders the entries of A so that the first N entries
    are exactly the diagonal entries of the matrix, in order.

    It is possible that a pair of indices (I,J) may occur more than
    once.  Presumably, in this case, the intent is that the actual value
    of A(I,J) is the sum of all such entries.  This is not a good thing
    to do, but I seem to have come across this in MATLAB.

    The R8SP format is used by CSPARSE ("sparse triplet"), DLAP/SLAP
    (nonsymmetric case), by MATLAB, and by SPARSEKIT ("COO" format).

    The original M by N matrix is "collapsed" downward, so that diagonals
    become rows of the storage array, while columns are preserved.  The
    collapsed array is logically 2*ML+MU+1 by N.  

    The two dimensional array can be further reduced to a one dimensional
    array, stored by columns.

    LINPACK and LAPACK band storage requires that an extra ML
    superdiagonals be supplied to allow for fillin during Gauss
    elimination.  Even though a band matrix is described as
    having an upper bandwidth of MU, it effectively has an
    upper bandwidth of MU+ML.  This routine will copy nonzero
    values it finds in these extra bands, so that both unfactored
    and factored matrices can be handled.

    Now, assuming that only a few of these diagonals contain nonzeros,

  Purpose:

    R8GD_MXV multiplies a R8GD matrix by a vector.

  Discussion:

    The R8GD storage format is used for matrices whose only nonzero entries

    Now, assuming that only a few of these diagonals contain nonzeros,
    then for the I-th diagonal to be saved, we stored its offset in
    OFFSET(I), and its entries in column I of the matrix.

  Purpose:

    R8GE_CO factors a R8GE matrix and estimates its condition number.

  Discussion:

    The R8GE storage format is used for a "general" M by N matrix.  
    A physical storage space is made for each logical entry.  The two 
    dimensional logical array is mapped to a vector, in which storage is 
    by columns.

    For the system A * X = B, relative perturbations in A and B
    of size EPSILON may cause relative perturbations in X of size
    EPSILON/RCOND.

    If RCOND is so small that the logical expression
      1.0 + rcond == 1.0
    is true, then A may be singular to working precision.  In particular,
    RCOND is zero if exact singularity is detected or the estimate
    underflows.

/*
  Purpose:

    R8GE_ILU produces the incomplete LU factors of a R8GE matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8GE storage format is used for a "general" M by N matrix.  
    A physical storage space is made for each logical entry.  The two 
    dimensional logical array is mapped to a vector, in which storage is 
    by columns.

    The incomplete LU factors of the M by N matrix A are:

      L, an M by M unit lower triangular matrix,
      U, an M by N upper triangular matrix

    with the property that L and U are computed in the same way as
    the usual LU factors, except that, whenever an off diagonal element
    of the original matrix is zero, then the corresponding value of
    U is forced to be zero.

    This condition means that it is no longer the case that A = L*U.

    On the other hand, L and U will have a simple sparsity structure
    related to that of A.  The incomplete LU factorization is generally
    used as a preconditioner in iterative schemes applied to sparse
    matrices.  It is presented here merely for illustration.

  Purpose:

    R8GE_NP_TRS solves a system of linear equations factored by R8GE_NP_TRF.

  Discussion:

    The R8GE storage format is used for a "general" M by N matrix.  
    A physical storage space is made for each logical entry.  The two 
    dimensional logical array is mapped to a vector, in which storage is

    R8GE_NP_TRS is a nonpivoting version of R8GE_TRS.

    R8GE_TRS solves a system of linear equations
      A * x = b  or  A' * X = B
    with a general N by N matrix A using the LU factorization computed
    by R8GE_NP_TRF.

    (Actually, it is not necessary to solve the system once using R8GE_SL_NEW.
    You may simply supply the initial estimated solution X = 0.)

    Each time this routine is called, it will compute the residual in
    the linear system, apply one step of iterative refinement, and

/*
  Purpose:

    R8GE_TO_R8GB copies a R8GE matrix to a R8GB matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8GE storage format is used for a "general" M by N matrix.  
    A physical storage space is made for each logical entry.  The two 
    dimensional logical array is mapped to a vector, in which storage is 
    by columns.

    The R8GB storage format is for an M by N banded matrix, with lower
    bandwidth ML and upper bandwidth MU.  Storage includes room for ML
    extra superdiagonals, which may be required to store nonzero entries
    generated during Gaussian elimination.

    It usually doesn't make sense to try to store a general matrix
    in a band matrix format.  You can always do it, but it will take
    more space, unless the general matrix is actually banded.

    The purpose of this routine is to allow a user to set up a
    banded matrix in the easy-to-use general format, and have this
    routine take care of the compression of the data into general
    format.  All the user has to do is specify the bandwidths.

    Note that this routine "believes" what the user says about the
    bandwidth.  It will assume that all entries in the general matrix
    outside of the bandwidth are zero.

    The original M by N matrix is "collapsed" downward, so that diagonals
    become rows of the storage array, while columns are preserved.  The
    collapsed array is logically 2*ML+MU+1 by N.

    LINPACK and LAPACK band storage requires that an extra ML
    superdiagonals be supplied to allow for fillin during Gauss
    elimination.  Even though a band matrix is described as
    having an upper bandwidth of MU, it effectively has an
    upper bandwidth of MU+ML.  This routine will copy nonzero
    values it finds in these extra bands, so that both unfactored
    and factored matrices can be handled.

  Purpose:

    R8PBU_CG uses the conjugate gradient method on a R8PBU system.

  Discussion:

    The R8PBU storage format is used for a symmetric positive definite band matrix.

    To save storage, only the diagonal and upper triangle of A is stored,
    in a compact diagonal format that preserves columns.

    The diagonal is stored in row MU+1 of the array.
    The first superdiagonal in row MU, columns 2 through N.

    The MU-th superdiagonal in row 1, columns MU+1 through N.

    The matrix A must be a positive definite symmetric band matrix.

    The method is designed to reach the solution after N computational
    steps.  However, roundoff may introduce unacceptably large errors for
    some problems.  In such a case, calling the routine again, using
    the computed solution as the new starting estimate, should improve
    the results.

  Purpose:

    R8PBU_RANDOM randomizes a R8PBU matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8PBU storage format is used for a symmetric positive definite band matrix.

    To save storage, only the diagonal and upper triangle of A is stored,
    in a compact diagonal format that preserves columns.

    The diagonal is stored in row MU+1 of the array.
    The first superdiagonal in row MU, columns 2 through N.
    The second superdiagonal in row MU-1, columns 3 through N.
    The MU-th superdiagonal in row 1, columns MU+1 through N.

    The matrix returned will be positive definite, but of limited
    randomness.  The off diagonal elements are random values between
    0 and 1, and the diagonal element of each row is selected to
    ensure strict diagonal dominance.

/*
  Purpose:

    R8S3_READ reads a square R8S3 matrix from a file.

  Discussion:

    This routine needs the value of NZ_NUM, which can be determined
    by a call to R8S3_READ_SIZE.

    The R8S3 storage format corresponds to the SLAP Triad format.

    The R8S3 storage format stores the row, column and value of each nonzero
    entry of a sparse matrix.  The entries may be given in any order.  No
    check is made for the erroneous case in which a given matrix entry is
    specified more than once.

    There is a symmetry option for square matrices.  If the symmetric storage
    option is used, the format specifies that only nonzeroes on the diagonal
    and lower triangle are stored.  However, this routine makes no attempt
    to enforce this.  The only thing it does is to "reflect" any nonzero
    offdiagonal value.  Moreover, no check is made for the erroneous case
    in which both A(I,J) and A(J,I) are specified, but with different values.

double *r8sd_cg ( int n, int ndiag, int offset[], double a[], double b[],

/******************************************************************************/
/*
  Purpose:

    R8SD_CG uses the conjugate gradient method on a R8SD linear system.

  Discussion:

    The R8SD storage format is used for symmetric matrices whose only nonzero entries
    occur along a few diagonals, but for which these diagonals are not all
    close enough to the main diagonal for band storage to be efficient.

    In that case, we assign the main diagonal the offset value 0, and 
    each successive superdiagonal gets an offset value 1 higher, until
    the highest superdiagonal (the A(1,N) entry) is assigned the offset N-1.

    Assuming there are NDIAG nonzero diagonals (ignoring subdiagonals!),
    we then create an array B that has N rows and NDIAG columns, and simply
    "collapse" the matrix A to the left:

    For the conjugate gradient method to be applicable, the matrix A must 
    be a positive definite symmetric matrix.

    The method is designed to reach the solution to the linear system
      A * x = b
    after N computational steps.  However, roundoff may introduce
    unacceptably large errors for some problems.  In such a case,
    calling the routine a second time, using the current solution estimate
    as the new starting guess, should result in improved results.

  Purpose:

    R8SD_RANDOM randomizes a R8SD matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8SD storage format is used for symmetric matrices whose only nonzero entries
    occur along a few diagonals, but for which these diagonals are not all
    close enough to the main diagonal for band storage to be efficient.

    In that case, we assign the main diagonal the offset value 0, and

    the highest superdiagonal (the A(1,N) entry) is assigned the offset N-1.

    Assuming there are NDIAG nonzero diagonals (ignoring subdiagonals!),

/*
  Purpose:

    R8SP_TO_R8GE converts a R8SP matrix to a R8GE matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8SP storage format stores the row, column and value of each nonzero
    entry of a sparse matrix.

    It is possible that a pair of indices (I,J) may occur more than
    once.  Presumably, in this case, the intent is that the actual value
    of A(I,J) is the sum of all such entries.  This is not a good thing
    to do, but I seem to have come across this in MATLAB.

    The R8SP format is used by CSPARSE ("sparse triplet"), DLAP/SLAP
    (nonsymmetric case), by MATLAB, and by SPARSEKIT ("COO" format).

/*
  Purpose:

    R8SP_TO_R8NCF converts a R8SP matrix to a R8NCF matrix.

  Discussion:

    The R8SP and R8NCF formats are essentially identical, except that
    R8SP keeps separate ROW and COLUMN vectors, while R8NCF uses a single
    ROWCOL array.  Therefore, the input values NZ_NUM and A used in
    the R8SP representation can be regarded as part of the output
    values used for the R8NCF representation.

    The R8SP storage format stores the row, column and value of each nonzero
    entry of a sparse matrix.

    It is possible that a pair of indices (I,J) may occur more than
    once.  Presumably, in this case, the intent is that the actual value
    of A(I,J) is the sum of all such entries.  This is not a good thing

    The R8SP format is used by CSPARSE ("sparse triplet"), DLAP/SLAP
    (nonsymmetric case), by MATLAB, and by SPARSEKIT ("COO" format).

    The R8NCF storage format stores NZ_NUM, the number of nonzeros,
    a real array containing the nonzero values, a 2 by NZ_NUM integer
    array storing the row and column of each nonzero entry.

    The R8NCF format is used by NSPCG.  NSPCG requires that the information
    for the diagonal entries of the matrix must come first.

  Discussion:

    The R8SS storage format is used for real symmetric skyline matrices.

  Discussion:

    The R8STO storage format is used for a symmetric Toeplitz matrix.
    It stores the N elements of the first row.

    For this routine, the matrix is also required to be positive definite.

    The original implementation of the algorithm assumed that the
    diagonal element was 1.  The algorithm has been modified so that
    this is no longer necessary.

    The inverse matrix is NOT guaranteed to be a Toeplitz matrix.  
    It is guaranteed to be symmetric and persymmetric.
    The inverse matrix is returned in general storage, that is,
    as an "SGE" matrix.

  Example:

    To compute the inverse of

     1.0 0.5 0.2
     0.5 1.0 0.5
     0.2 0.5 1.0

    we input:

      N = 3
      A = { 1.0, 0.5, 0.2 }

    with output:

      B = ( 1/56) * [ 75, -40,   5,
                     -40,  96, -40,
                       5, -40,  75 ]

    This implementation of the algorithm assumes that the diagonal element

    The real symmetric Toeplitz matrix can be described by N numbers, which,

  Parameters:

    Input, int N, the length of the input list.

    Input/output, int *INDX.
    The user must set INDX to 0 before the first call.
    On return,
      if INDX is greater than 0, the user must interchange
      items I and J and recall the routine.
      If INDX is less than 0, the user is to compare items I
      and J and return in ISGN a negative value if I is to
      precede J, and a positive value otherwise.
      If INDX is 0, the sorting is done.

    Output, int *I, *J.  On return with INDX positive,
    elements I and J of the user's list should be
    interchanged.  On return with INDX negative, elements I
    and J are to be compared by the user.

    user should compare elements I and J of the list.  If
