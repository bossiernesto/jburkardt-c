      PCL_READ <br> Extract Numeric Data from a PCL File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PCL_READ</b> 
      is a C program which
       reads a PCL file and writes a copy containing only
      the numeric data.  The main reason for doing this is so that the
      resulting file can easily be read by a program as pure numeric data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The PCL files we are considering contain gene expression data
      from experiments on Arabidopsis.  The first line of the file contains
      a (long) list of labels.  There follow N records, each containing
      3 labels and 14 numeric values, separated by TAB characters.  
      PCL_READ reads this data, ignoring the title and labels, and writes
      N records of numeric data to a new file.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>pcl_read</b> <i>file.pcl</i> <i>file.txt</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>file.pcl</i> is the name of the PCL file to be read.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>file.txt</i> is the name of the text file to be created, which will contain
          the numeric data in the PCL file.
        </li>
      </ul>
