      F90SPLIT <br> Split FORTRAN90 Source Files
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>F90SPLIT</b> 
      is a C program which 
      reads a FORTRAN90
      source code, and writes each module to a separate file.  A module 
      is considered to be a FORTRAN BLOCKDATA, FUNCTION, MODULE, 
      PROGRAM or SUBROUTINE.
    </p>

    <p>
      Procedure <i>X</i> is put in file <i>X.f90</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Comments preceding a procedure, and not associated with a 
      preceding procedure, are included with that procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      You cannot use the more elaborate END statements that include the
      procedure definition, such as "END FUNCTION ALPHA".
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>f90split</b> <i>myprog.f90</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>myprog.f90</i> is the file to be split.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <a href = "../../f_src/fixcon/fixcon.html">
      FIXCON</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a FORTRAN file using FORTRAN77 continuation statements,
