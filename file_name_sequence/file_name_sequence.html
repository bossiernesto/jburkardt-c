    <p>
      <b>FILE_NAME_SEQUENCE</b> 
      is a C library which 
      demonstrates ways of generating a sequence of file names
      with an embedded index that increases.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are situations such as animations or parallel processing in which
      it is necessary to generate a sequence of file names which include
      an embedded index that increases.  A simple example might be
      <pre>
        "fred0.txt", "fred1.txt", "fred2.txt"
      </pre>
      A side issue arises when the number of files is large enough that the
      number of digits in the index will vary.  Thus, if we are going to have
      15 files, do we want to number them as
      <pre>
        "fred00.txt" through "fred14.txt"
      </pre>
      which means, for one thing, that they will alphabetize properly, or
      will we be satisfied with
      <pre>
        "fred0.txt" through "fred14.txt" ?
      </pre>
    </p>
