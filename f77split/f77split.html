    <P>
      <b>F77SPLIT</b>
      is a C program which 
      reads a FORTRAN77 source code, and writes each module to a separate file.  A module 
      is considered to be a FORTRAN BLOCKDATA, FUNCTION, MODULE, 
      PROGRAM or SUBROUTINE.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>f77split</b> <i>myprog.f</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>myprog.f</i> is the file to be split.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Related Data and Programs:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../cpp_src/catalog/catalog.html">
      CATALOG</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 program and prints every line 
      that begins with a special index tag.  If the program has been marked
      up expecting this convention, it is a handy way of making a table
      of contents of a program file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/extract/extract.html">
      EXTRACT</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      extracts a subroutine, function or module by name from a 
      FORTRAN file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/f90split/f90split.html">
      F90SPLIT</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      can split a FORTRAN90 file, assigning each subroutine
      or function to a separate file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/fixcon/fixcon.html">
      FIXCON</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a FORTRAN file using FORTRAN77 continuation statements,
      and makes a copy that uses FORTRAN90 continuation instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../cpp_src/htmlindex/htmlindex.html">
      HTMLINDEX</a>,
      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77, or FORTRAN90 file and writes a skeleton HTML page describing it,
      assuming that each subroutine includes a '!!' or 'cc' description line.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/include_files/include_files.html">
      INCLUDE_FILES</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      reads a FORTRAN program with INCLUDE statements, and makes a copy
      with the indicated files included.
