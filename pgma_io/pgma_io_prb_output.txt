PGMA_IO_PRB:
  C version
  Tests for PGMA_IO, ASCII PGM routines.

TEST01:
  PGMA_EXAMPLE sets up ASCII PGM data.
  PGMA_WRITE writes an ASCII PGM file.

  Writing the file "pgma_io_prb_01.ascii.pgm".

  PGMA_EXAMPLE has set up the data.

  PGMA_WRITE was successful.

PGMA_READ_TEST:
  PGMA_READ was able to read "pgma_io_prb_01.ascii.pgm".

PGMA_READ_TEST:
  PGMA_CHECK_DATA has approved the data from the file.

  PGMA_READ_TEST was able to read our file.

TEST02
  PGMA_READ reads the header and data of an ASCII PGM file.

  Reading the file "pgma_io_prb_02.ascii.pgm".

  PGMA_WRITE_TEST created some test data.

  PGMA_READ read the test data successfully.

  Sample data:

   0     0      60
  33    33      73
  66    66      34
  99    99      45

 265   265       7
 299   299      19

TEST03:
  PGMA_WRITE writes an ASCII PGM file.

  In this example, we make a sort of grayscale
  checkerboard.
  Writing the file "pgma_io_prb_03.ascii.pgm".
