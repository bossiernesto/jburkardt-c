      GRAPHCHK <br> Verify a METIS Graph File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GRAPHCHK</b> 
      is a C program which
      can read a METIS GRAPH file defining a graph for use by the <b>METIS</b>
      program, and verify that the file has the correct format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rules for the METIS GRAPH format are defined in the manual,
      and examples are given in the METIS GRAPH data directory.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To check that a graph file is really in the correct format 
      preferred by <b>METIS</b>:
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>graphchk</b> <i>graph_file</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the graph information in <i>graph_file</i> and reports
          whether it is acceptable.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
