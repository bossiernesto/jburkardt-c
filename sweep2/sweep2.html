      SWEEP2 <br> Voronoi and Delaunay Calculations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SWEEP2</b> 
      is a C program which 
      computes the Voronoi diagram 
      or Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in the plane,
      by Steve Fortune.
    </p>

    <p>
      Input to the program is a text file containing the coordinates of
      points in the plane.  Each input line consists of two real values
      separated by spaces or tab characters.  If the <b>-s</b> option is
      used, then the points should be sorted by <b>Y</b> coordinate, and
      an extra initial line should be inserted into the file, having the
      form
      <blockquote><i>
        npoints xmin xmax ymin ymax
      </i></blockquote>
      indicating the number of points and their range.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the program outputs a description of the Voronoi diagram.
      The description of this structure is fairly complicated.  There
      are four kinds of records in the output file:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>s</b> x y<br>
          indicates an input point (or "site") at <b>(x,y)</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>v</b> x y<br>
          indicates a Voronoi vertex at the point <b>(x,y)</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>l</b> a b c<br>
          indicates a line with the equation <b>a*x+b*y=c</b>.  These
          lines are not actually drawn, but are used in the description
          of the <i>next</i> object;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>e</b> l v1 v2<br>
          indicates a Voronoi edge, which is the segment of the
          line with index <i>l</i> that extends from Voronoi vertex
          <i>v1</i> to <i>v2</i>.  If either vertex has the value -1,
          this indicates that the line segment is actually a semi-infinite
          ray, which extends to infinity on that side;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the <b>-t</b> command line option is specified, then the program 
      outputs a description of the Delaunay triangulation.  This is
      a simple item to describe.  Each line of output 
      lists the indices of three input points that are to be connected
      to form one of the triangles of the triangulation.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>sweep2</b> -p -s -t < <i>data.txt</i><br>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the file <i>data.txt</i> for a set of points in the plane 
          and writes either the Voronoi diagram or the Delaunay triangulation 
          to the standard output.  Each input line consists of two real values
          separated by spaces or tab characters.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Command line options:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>-p</b>: indicates that the output file should be formatted
              for use with the UNIX <b>plot</b> command instead of the usual
              output format;  (In my copy, this switch does nothing,
              because I don't have <b>plot</b> set up.)
            </li>
           <li>
              <b>-s</b>: indicates that the input file has been sorted by <b>Y</b>
              coordinate.  In this case, an extra line should be inserted at the
              head of the input file containing the special information 
              <blockquote><i>
                npoints xmin xmax ymin ymax
              </i></blockquote>
              indicating the number of points and their range.  This option
              is for efficiency, since it allows the program to skip the
              sorting step.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>-t</b>: indicates that the Delaunay triangulation is to 
              be output.  If this option is not specified, then the 
              Voronoi diagram is output.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
      </dl>
