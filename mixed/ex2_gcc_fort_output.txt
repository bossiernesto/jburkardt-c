 
FOR1
  The C routine passed in the following 2D array:
 
    1    4    7
    2    5    8
    3    6    9
 
FOR1:
  Reset the array so that A(I,J) = 10*I+J:
 
FOR1
  The output array is:
 
   11   12   13
   21   22   23
   31   32   33
 
FOR2:
  Received numeric input from a C main program:
 
  Integer:              13
  Real:                42.8500    
  Complex:             123.450       6.78900    
  Double precision:    12345.0    
 
FOR2 transforms these numbers to:
 
  Integer:              30
  Real:                6.54599    
  Complex:             5289.83      0.158436    
  Double precision:    6172.50    
 
FOR3 calls a C routine to get the current directory.
 
 
FOR3:
  C1 returns the current working directory as:
/a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/c_src/mixed
 
FOR4:
  On input, ARRAY has the value:
 
    1    4    7
    2    5    8
    3    6    9
 
FOR4:
  Call C2 to adjust the array.
 
FOR4:
  On return from C2, ARRAY is:
 
    2    5    8
    3    6    9
    4    7   10

MAIN:
  An example of a C/FORTRAN interface.
  The main program is written in C.
  It calls FORTRAN routines, which in turn call C routines.


TEST01:
  Define a 3 by 3 integer array in a C routine.
  Pass it to a FORTRAN routine for modification.
  Examine the returned value.

TEST01:
  Here is the initial value of ARRAY:
   1    2    3 
   4    5    6 
   7    8    9 


TEST01:
  Now we pass ARRAY to the FORTRAN routine FOR1 for processing.

TEST01:
  After return from FOR1, here is ARRAY:
  11   21   31 
  12   22   32 
  13   23   33 


TEST02:
  Pass numeric data to a FORTRAN routine, alter it, return it.

  Integer value = 13
  Real value = 42.849998
  Complex value = 123.449997 + 6.789000*i
  Double value = 12345.006789

TEST02
  Call FOR2 to modify these values.

TEST02:
  New values of data as modified by FOR2:

  Integer value = 30
  Real value = 6.545991
  Complex value = 5289.832031 + 0.158436*i
  Double value = 6172.503394

TEST03:
  Call a FORTRAN routine which calls a C routine.
  The C routine returns character data of some sort.

C1:
  By calling the library routine GETCWD, we see that
  the current working directory is /a/fs.csit.fsu.edu/u8/users/burkardt/public_html/c_src/mixed.

TEST04:
  Pass an array to a FORTRAN routine.
  The FORTRAN routine passes the array to a C routine.


C2:
  The input value of ARRAY:
   1    2    3 
   4    5    6 
   7    8    9 


C2:
  Modified value of ARRAY is:
   2    3    4 
   5    6    7 
   8    9   10 


MAIN:
  Normal end of execution.
