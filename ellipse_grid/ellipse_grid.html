      ELLIPSE_GRID <br> Grid Points Within an Ellipse
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ELLIPSE_GRID</b>
      is a C library which
      generates the grid points that lie inside an ellipse.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library allows the user to define an ellipse by
      choosing its center and the length of its major and minor axes.  
      The user also choose N, the number of subintervals into which the 
      minor radius will be subdivided.  It then returns the gridpoints 
      defined by that choice.
