          allocatable_array</a>,
          a program which
          demonstrates how a C function can declare a pointer to an array,
          pass it to a function, which can then allocate it and fill it with 
          data, and then return the allocated and initialized array to the 
          calling function through the argument list.

          a library which
          samples the uniform, normal or exponential distributions, 
          using the ziggurat method, by Marsaglia and Tsang.
          In this original version, the random number generators are
          implemented inline, for increased speed.
