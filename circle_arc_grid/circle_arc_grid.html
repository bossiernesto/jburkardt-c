      <b>PENTAGON</b> is a set of 6(!) equally spaced points from 0 to
      360 degrees.  This is the easiest way to get a pentagon, but
      you should really edit the file and remove the last point, since
      it repeats the first one.  The alternative is to specify that
      the angles range from 0 to 288 degrees!
