    <p>
      <b>FAIR_DICE_SIMULATION</b>
      is a C program which
      simulates N games in which two fair dice are thrown and summed,
      creating graphics files for processing by gnuplot.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>fair_dice_simulation</b> <i>n</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>n</i> is the number of times the 2 dice are thrown.
        </li>
