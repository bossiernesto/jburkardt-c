INTERVALS - Master process:
  C version

  An MPI example program,
  A quadrature over an interval is done by
  assigning subintervals to processes.

  The number of processes is 8

Process 0 is active!

Process 1 is active!

Process 2 is active!

Process 3 is active!

Process 4 is active!

Process 5 is active!

Process 6 is active!

INTERVALS - Master process:
  Subintervals have been assigned.

Process 7 is active!

INTERVALS - Master process:
  Estimate for PI is 3.141593
  Error is           0.000000

  Elapsed wall clock seconds = 0.033490

INTERVALS - Master process:
  Normal end of execution.
