      KMETIS <br> Graph Partitioning using METIS
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>KMETIS</b> 
      is a C program which 
      partitions the nodes of a graph using the <b>METIS</b> library.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically, the graph is being partitioned so that a
      computational task can be correspondingly divided up among
      a number of processors for parallel computing.  Thus, it is
      important that each part of the partition have roughly the
      same number of elements, and that "connections" between
      distinct partitions be limited, as much as possible, to
      reduce the amount of interprocess communication necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>KMETIS</b> uses <i>k</i>-way partitioning, and is best when the 
      number of parts is more than 8.  The related program <b>PMETIS</b> 
      uses multilevel recursive bisection and is best when
      the number of parts is 8 or less.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>KMETIS</b> uses particular formats for storing the graph,
      mesh or matrix data.  The formats have extended to include
      the ability to weight certain items.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>KMETIS</b> can be executed on a single processor.  However,
      <b>KMETIS</b> includes an <b>MPI</b> interface which allows it
      to be run in parallel as well.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To partition the nodes of a graph, minimizing the number
      of edge cuts:
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>kmetis</b> <i>graph_file</i> <i>nparts</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the node adjacency information in <i>graph_file</i>,
          assigns each node to processor 0 through <i>nparts-1</i>, 
          and writes the partitioning to the file
          <i>graph_file.part.nparts</i>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
