      SGEFA_OPENMP <br> Sequential and OpenMP versions of Linpack Solver
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SGEFA_OPENMP</b> 
      is a C program which 
      reimplements the SGEFA/SGESL linear algebra routines from
      LINPACK for use with OpenMP.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, running for N = 10, 100 and 1000, but only using a 2 Processor
      Apple G5, the parallel code is not doing well at all.  I will try to find
      out what is holding it back.
