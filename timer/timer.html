      TIMER <br> Compute Elapsed Time
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TIMER</b> 
      is a directory of C programs which 
      demonstrate ways of computing the elapse CPU time or elapsed
      wall clock time in a calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is that you want to
      determine the amount of time taken by a piece of your code, so
      you write lines like this:
      <pre><tt>
        time1 = timer ( );
        for (  i = 0; i < n; i++ )
          ...some big calculation...
        }
        time2 = timer ( );
        printf ( "Elapsed CPU time = %f seconds\n", time2 - time1 );
      </pre></tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      You should not trust a timer that you only use once.  If you run the same code
      several times in a row, you are likely to get different results,
      especially if you are trying to time things that don't take long.
      The time will often also vary depending on the system load,
      the number of other users or processes running, and other factors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another problem is "wrap around".  Some timers reach a maximum value,
      and then reset themselves to zero.  If this happens to you, (it's
      happened to me many times!) you may find that a certain procedure 
      seems to take negative time!
    </p>

    <p>
      Some timers return CPU time, that is, the amount of elapsed computer
      time that was used by your program; other routines return "real" time
      or "wall clock" time, which will not account for situations in which 
      your program started, and then was paused for some reason (swapped out, 
      waiting for I/O, or other system functions), and then finished.  
    </p>

    <p>
      For parallel programming, the important thing to measure is the elapsed
      wallclock time.  This can be found by subtracting an initial reading of
      the wallclock time from a final one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The OpenMP system provides a function used as follows:
      <pre>
        seconds = omp_get_wtime ( )
        operations to time;
        seconds = omp_get_wtime ( ) - seconds;
      </pre>
      while the MPI system provides a similar function used as:
      <pre>
        seconds = MPI_Wtime ( );
        operations;
        seconds = MPI_Wtime ( ) - seconds;
      </pre>
      and in MATLAB, wallclock time can be taken with "tic" and "toc":
      <pre>
        tic;
        operation;
        seconds = toc;
      </pre>
    </p>
