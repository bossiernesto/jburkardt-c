      OPENMP_STUBS <br> A C Stub Library for OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>OPENMP_STUBS</b> 
      is a C library which 
      constitutes a stub implementation of the OpenMP 2.5 standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      A stub library is useful when you want to try out a program on a system
      that does not have OpenMP, or when you need to have a formally complete
      program to analyze, or in other cases where you want to ignore the actual
      OpenMP library.  A stub library can also help to understand the structure
      of the actual library.

        Note that these examples are normally run in parallel with OpenMP.
        The point being made here is that such programs can be run sequentially,
        as though OpenMP were available, by calling the OPENMP_STUBS library.
        They don't run well (fast) - it's just remarkable that they run at all.
