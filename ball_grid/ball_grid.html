      BALL_GRID <br> Grid Points Within a 3D Ball
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BALL_GRID</b>
      is a C library which
      generates the grid points that lie inside a 3D ball.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library allows the user to define an arbitrary ball by
      choosing its radius and center.  The user also choose N, the number
      of subintervals into which a horizontal radius line will be subdivided.
      It then returns the gridpoints defined by that choice.
