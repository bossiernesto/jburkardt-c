    <p>
      <b>ELLIPSOID_GRID</b>
      is a C library which
      generates the grid points that lie inside an ellipsoid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library allows the user to define an ellipsoid by
      choosing the 3D coordinates of its center and the lengths of its three axes.  
      The user also choose N, the number of subintervals into which the 
      shortest radius will be subdivided.  It then returns the gridpoints 
      defined by that choice.
