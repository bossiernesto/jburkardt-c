      XWAVES <br> X Window Simulation of Wave Equations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>XWAVES</b>
      is a C program which
      illustrates the behaviors of three common wave equations,
      by Michael Creutz.
    </p>

    <p>
      First is the simple wave equation with <b>w</b>
      proportional to <b>k</b>; this is the equation is obeyed by free photons.
      Second is the Klein-Gordon equation with <b>w</b> proportional to the
      <b>sqrt(k^2+m^2)</b> with <b>m</b> a constant representing a particle
      mass, say that of the electron or a pion.  Finally is the equation for
      long wavelength water waves, which obey <b>w</b> proportional to
      <b>sqrt(k)</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program starts with wave packets cycling around the periodic
      boundary conditions.  The equation is that for light, and the wave
      packets move with the same velocity as the short waves of which they
      are composed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you now click on the "mesons" button, the mass term of the
      Klein-Gordon equation is turned on.  Note how the short components now
      move faster than the packets.  This illustrates how the group velocity
      of a wave equation can differ from the phase velocity.  For the
      Klein-Gordon equation, the phase velocity exceeds the speed of light,
      but this is not a problem because information is carried only by wave
      packets, which move at the group velocity.  The latter is always less
      than the speed of light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Selecting the water button shows a similar effect.  In this case the
      group velocity is exactly one half the phase velocity.  This follows
      from the frequency going as the square root of the wavelength.  This
      is my favorite example of an interesting result following from
      dimensional analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematically, the phase velocity <b>v_p</b> of a wave equation is
      given by the relation
      <blockquote><b>
        v_p = w / k
      </b></blockquote>
      while the group velocity <b>v_g</b> is
      <blockquote><b>
        v_g = dw / dk
      </b></blockquote>
      Only for the simple wave equation are these equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program has a variety of other buttons to play with.  The
      "quit," ``pause,'' and ``slow'' buttons do the obvious things.  A
      mouse click in the wave portion of the window will insert a
      disturbance, much like throwing a rock into a pond.  The "damp"
      button slowly damps out any waves present, while "vacuum" settles
      the system immediately.  The "reverse" button reverses the motion of
      all waves.  The "right" button eliminates all left moving waves.
      Pressing "packet" restores the initial two packet state.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "blob" gadget changes the display so the waves run around a
      spherical blob rather than along the periodic line.  The "drift"
      button lets that blob drift around and bounce off the window walls.
      It has no effect when not in the blob display mode.  A highly excited
      drifting blob with the slow button seems like a blend of Matisse with
      a lava lamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      For each one of the three equations, try calming the state with the
      vacuum button and then exciting a pulse with a mouse click.  Observe
      how the light equation gives a pulse dividing into oppositely moving
      pieces that move without changing shape.  With the meson equation, an
      oscillating central region emits at first short wavelengths followed
      by longer ones.  With water, the long waves are the first to leave the
      excitation region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some technical details: The waves are displayed using the Xlib routine
      XPolyFill() with 256 points on the wave surface.  To avoid
      discretization errors, the evolution is calculated in momentum space
      and then a fast Fourier transform gives the position space
      coordinates.  You can easily obtain other wave equations by modifying
      the routine makedispersion().
