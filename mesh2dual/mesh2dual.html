      MESH2DUAL <br> Convert Finite Element Mesh to Dual Graph
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MESH2DUAL</b> 
      is a C program which 
      converts a finite element mesh to a dual graph.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The mesh file is stored in the <b>METIS MESH</b> format, and the
      resulting graph file is stored in the <b>METIS GRAPH</b> format.
    </p>

    <p>
      This operation simplifies the use of
      the <b>METIS</b> partitioning program, which can work directly 
      on the resulting graph.  If the same finite element mesh is
      being used a number of times, it is more efficient for the
      user to convert the mesh once to a graph, rather than having
      <b>METIS</b> do it each time.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To convert a finite element mesh file into the graph format 
      preferred by <b>METIS</b>:
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>mesh2dual</b> <i>mesh_file</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the mesh information in <i>mesh_file</i>,
          constructs and writes the dual graph.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
