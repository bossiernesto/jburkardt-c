      PARTNMESH <br> Partition a Finite Element Mesh
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PARTNMESH</b> 
      is a C program which
      can partition the elements of a finite element mesh.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The program attempts to partition the mesh in such a way
      that each part has roughly the same number of elements, and so
      that the number of "interfaces" between parts is minimized.
      Such a partition can be very useful when parallel processing
      is to be applied.
    </p>

    <p>
      The partition is done on the <i>elements</i> of the finite element mesh;
      however, this naturally induces a pseudo-partition of the nodes.
      A subset of the nodes will be associated with the elements belonging
      to each part of the partition - however, there will of course be
      some nodes that belong to more than one "part" of the pseudo-partition
      of the nodes.  (This is not really a deep idea; it's just important
      to realize that while each element is in exactly one part, some nodes
      may be in several parts).  
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PARTNMESH</b> will produce both a list of the elements belonging
      to each part of the partition, and a list of the nodes belonging
      to each associated part of the pseudopartition of the nodes. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The mesh file is stored in the <b>METIS MESH</b> format.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PARTNMESH</b> works with the nodal graph of the mesh.  Generally,
      this is faster than the corresponding program <b>PARTDMESH</b>,
      which works with the dual graph of the mesh.  Either program
      may be used to get equivalent results.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>partnmesh</b> <i>mesh_file</i> <i>nparts</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>mesh_file</i> contains the mesh information;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>nparts</i> is the number of parts to create
        </li>
      </ul>
      reads the mesh information in <i>mesh_file</i>,
      assigns each node and element to processor 0 through <i>nparts-1</i>, 
      and writes the partitionings to the file
      <i>mesh_file.npart.Nparts</i> for the nodes and
      <i>mesh_file.epart.Nparts</i> for the elements.
