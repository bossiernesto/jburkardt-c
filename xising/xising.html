      XISING <br> An X Window Simulation of the Ising Model
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>XISING</b>
      is a C program which
      illustrates a Monte Carlo
      simulation of a simple statistical mechanical system,
      by Michael Creutz.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ising
      model demonstrates ferromagnetism, displaying a second order phase
      transition from a disordered state at high temperature to an ordered
      state when cool.  The program allows dynamical observation of this
      system under several simple Monte Carlo algorithms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system is a two dimensional array of spins, each of which is
      represented by a bit in a bit map displayed on the screen.  Black and
      grey represent the two possible states of a given spin.  The energy of
      the system is entirely determined by nearest neighbor pairs.  If two
      neighbors are the same, then the energy has one value, and if they
      differ, it is higher by two units.
    </p>

      What the Screen Displays:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The display shows the spins in the image labeled "spins."  This is
      above another bit map labeled "changes," representing the spins being
      changed under the current algorithm.  The display has a thermometer to
      indicate the temperature and various buttons for controlling the
      updating.  The inverse temperature, beta, is displayed above the
      thermometer.  The critical value for beta is exactly known to be
      0.5*log(1+sqrt(2))=.44068.... The critical temperature is marked on
      the thermometer.
    </p>

    <p>
      One set of three buttons, labeled "run free," "heat," and "cool," are
      for adjusting the temperature.  Normal running is with the
      energy/temperature conserved, but to heat or cool the system toggle
      the appropriate button.  In a canonical mode (see below) the
      temperature can also be adjusted by clicking on the thermometer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another set of buttons controls the boundary conditions.  The choices
      include "periodic," wherein the spin neighbors at an edge are those
      on the opposite edge, and "antiperiodic," which is similar but with the
      the wrapped neighbors inverted.  The other two boundary choices
      are constant white or black.  The latter two are not permitted when
      the cluster algorithm, discussed below, is in operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithm button toggles between two alternatives.  The program
      starts with a "local" updating scheme.  This can be toggled into a
      variation of the "cluster" algorithm of R.H. Swendsen and J.-S. Wang,
      Physical Review Letters 58, 86 (1987), where a large block of spins is
      grown and then flipped in unison.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the bottom of the display is a button that switches between a
      canonical and a microcanonical updating.  The latter case is described
      in some detail in my paper Physical Review Letters 50, 1411 (1983).  A set
      of "demons" circulates around the lattice trying to flip spins.  Each
      carries a two bit sack of energy ranging from 0 to 16 units in steps
      of 4.  Any energy change associated with a spin flip is compensated by
      a change in this sack.  If the demon's sack cannot accommodate the
      change, the flip is rejected.  In this mode the temperature is not
      fixed, but calculated from the average demon energy.  Note the thermal
      fluctuations on the thermometer when in a microcanonical mode.  The
      microcanonical version of the cluster algorithm is discussed in
      Physical Review Letters 69, 1002 (1992).
    </p>

    <p>
      The program attains its speed by updating spins one word at a time
      using multispin coding and bit manipulation.  The canonical modes are
      obtained by allowing the demons to be occasionally refreshed by
      visiting a heat bath.  When in one of these, a mouse click near the
      thermometer will adjust the temperature to the value pointed at by the
      cursor.  Clicking elsewhere in the main window when the system is
      paused with any algorithm does a single step.  The remaining buttons,
      "quit" and "pause" should be self explanatory, as should the "speed"
      slider.  The lattice dimensions can be adjusted by resizing the
      window.

      Some Experiments:
    </h3>

    <p>
      After starting the program, press the heat button and observe how the
      domains get small and the acceptance, as shown in the "changes"
      display, gets large.  Then press the cool button until the
      temperature, as displayed in the thermometer, is below the critical
      value.  Watch the domains grow as the system magnetizes.  Note how the
      acceptance is largest at the domain boundaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      In many cases a single domain will grow to dominate the system.  If,
      however, bands of different phases wrap around the lattice in either a
      horizontal or vertical direction, then the system can have a hard time
      deciding which phase will dominate and it can remain metastable for a
      long time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Switching the boundary conditions to antiperiodic forces the system to
      have at least one domain wall.  Switching between black and white
      edges allows one to create large included domains which gradually
      shrink away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning the system to near the critical temperature, switch to
      the cluster algorithm.  In this case a few iterations quickly give
      independent configurations.  Heat the system and observe how
      the typical cluster size becomes quite small.  Cooling the system
      below the critical temperature gives single clusters covering most
      of the system, which then flashes between dominantly spin up and
      down.
    </p>

    <p>
      To illustrate the power of the cluster approach, use the local
      algorithm to heat the system to a high temperature and then rapidly
      quench it to somewhat below the critical value.  Before the local
      approach has had time to have the smaller domains dissolve in the
      dominant one, change to the cluster approach.  Note how quickly the
      cluster sweeps anneal out the included domains.
