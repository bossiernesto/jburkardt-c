SUPER_LU_S5:
  Solve multiple linear systems which share a sparsity,
  pattern.  Save time by letting SGSSVX know it can reuse.
  the sparsity pattern, rather than recomputing it.

  Length of work array LWORK = 0
  Equilibration option EQUIL = 1
  Diagonal pivot threshhold value U = 1.000000
  Tranpose option TRANS = 0
10x10 grid, with COLMMD order                                                   

  Dimension 100x100; # nonzeros 460
.. Use approximate minimum degree column ordering.

  First system: SGSSVX returns INFO = 0
  Number of nonzeros in factor L = 835
  Number of nonzeros in factor U = 978
  Number of nonzeros in L+U = 1713

  L\U MB 0.013	total MB needed 0.029	expansions 0
Factor time  =     0.00
Factor flops = 1.623300e+04	Mflops =     8.31
Solve time   =     0.00

  Second system: SGSSVX returns INFO = 0
  Number of nonzeros in factor L = 835
  Number of nonzeros in factor U = 978
  Number of nonzeros in L+U = 1713

  L\U MB 0.013	total MB needed 0.029	expansions 0
Factor time  =     0.00
Factor flops = 1.623300e+04	Mflops =     8.31
Solve time   =     0.00
