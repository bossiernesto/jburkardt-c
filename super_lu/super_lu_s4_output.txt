SUPER_LU_S4:
  Read a sparse matrix A from standard input,
  stored in Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix format.

  Using SGSSVX:
    Factor the matrix A;
    LATER, solve a linear system A * X = B.

  Length of work array LWORK = 0
  Equilibration option EQUIL = 1
  Diagonal pivot threshhold value U = 1.000000
  Tranpose option TRANS = 0
10x10 grid, with COLMMD order                                                   

  Dimension 100x100; # nonzeros 460
.. Use approximate minimum degree column ordering.

  LU factorization: SGSSVX returns INFO = 0
