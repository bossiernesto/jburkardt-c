      SUPER_LU <br> Sparse Linear Equation Solver
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUPER_LU</b>
      is a C library which
      implements some very fast
      solvers for sparse systems of linear equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SUPER_LU</b> contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear
      system A*X=B.  It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP).
      The columns of A may be preordered before factorization; the
      preordering for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SUPER_LU</b> is implemented in ANSI C, and must be compiled with
      an ANSI C compiler.  It provides functionality for both real
      and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.  The
      initial letter of a routine name indicates the arithmetic type
      and precision:
      <ul>
        <li>
          S, such as <b>sgstrf</b>, is for single precision real arithmetic;
        </li>
        <li>
          D, such as <b>dgstrf</b>, is for double precision real arithmetic;
        </li>
        <li>
          C, such as <b>cgstrf</b>, is for single precision complex arithmetic;
        </li>
        <li>
          Z, such as <b>zgstrf</b>, is for double precision complex arithmetic.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SUPER_LU</b> invokes routines from the BLAS
      (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms).  For best efficiency, a user
      should link <b>SUPER_LU</b> with an optimized version of the BLAS
      for the given machine architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the DEC/Compaq/HP Alpha, for instance, this can be done by linking
      with the Compaq Extended Math Library, or CXML.
