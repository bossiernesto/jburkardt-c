SUPER_LU_D4:
  Read a sparse matrix A from standard input,
  stored in Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix format.

  Using SGSSVX:
    Factor the matrix A;
    LATER, solve a linear system A * X = B.

  Length of work array LWORK = 0
  Equilibration option EQUIL = 1
  Diagonal pivot threshhold value U = 1.000000
  Tranpose option TRANS = 0
10x10 grid, with COLMMD order                                                   

  Dimension 100x100; # nonzeros 460
.. Use approximate minimum degree column ordering.

  LU factorization: DGSSVX returns INFO = 0

  Number of nonzeros in factor L = 835
  Number of nonzeros in factor U = 978
  Number of nonzeros in L+U = 1713
  L\U MB 0.020	total MB needed 0.040	expansions 0
Factor time  =     0.00
Factor flops = 1.623300e+04	Mflops =     8.31
Solve time   =     0.00

  Triangular solve: DGSSVX returns INFO = 0
Factor time  =     0.00
Solve time   =     0.00

SUPER_LU_D4:
  Normal end of execution.
